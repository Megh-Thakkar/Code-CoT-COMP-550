[INST] Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request:
 Remember to respond with only the function definition, nothing else. You shall be provided pseudocode to generate more accurate code. You are provided an example to understand the structure. 
Task: Write a function to find the kth element in the given array. 
Tests:
 assert kth_element([12,3,5,7,19], 5, 2) == 3
assert kth_element([17,24,8,23], 4, 3) == 8
assert kth_element([16,21,25,36,4], 5, 4) == 36

 
EXAMPLE STARTS HERE
    Task: Write a program that extracts all substrings of length n from a given string.
    Tests:
    assert find_substrings("abc", 2) == ["ab", "bc"]
    assert find_substrings("abc", 3) == ["abc"]
    assert find_substrings("abc", 4) == []
    
    Pseudocode:
    function extract_substrings(string, n)
        # Initialize an empty list for substrings
        Initialize substrings as an empty list

        # Loop from start to the point where substring of length n can be extracted
        for every index in the string
            # Add substring of length n to the list
            append string[i:i + n] to substrings

        # Return the list of substrings
        return the substrings
    Code:
    def find_substrings(string, n):
        substrings = []
        for i in range(len(string) - n + 1):
            substrings.append(string[i:i + n])
        return substrings
EXAMPLE ENDS HERE     
 
Pseudocode:
function find_kth_element(array, k):
    # Check if the array is empty
    if array is empty:
        # If it is, return a message indicating that the array is empty
        return "The array is empty"

    # Check if k is less than 1 or greater than the length of the array
    if k is less than 1 or k is greater than the length of the array:
        # If it is, return a message indicating that k is out of range
        return "k is out of range"

    # If the array is not empty and k is within range, return the kth element
    return the kth element in the array
